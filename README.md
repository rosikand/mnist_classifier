# Streamlit MNIST Classifier app 

> MNIST MLP classifier with hosted Streamlit app. 
I made this repo mainly because Streamlit requires a public GH repo to use. However, it also showcases how to make an image classifier app using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) (as well as providing an example for using [torchplate](https://github.com/rosikand/torchplate)!).
